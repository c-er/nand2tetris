# nand2tetris

My implementations for the projects in the
[nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course. 

**NOTE**: If you are taking this course at a university or in some other setting
where looking at others' solutions is disallowed, you **should not** look into
the contents of any of the project directories.

- [x] Boolean Logic: build various logic gates using the NAND gate as an atom
- [x] Boolean Arithmetic: build an ALU using these logic gates
- [x] Sequential Logic: build registers and 16K RAM using the D-flip-flop as an atom
- [x] Machine Language: write a few programs in assembly
- [x] Computer Architecture: build an instruction decoder and arrange it with the ALU, memory, screen, and keyboard into a fully functional CPU
- [x] Assembler: build an assembler to translate from assembly into machine code
- [ ] VM 1: Stack Arithmetic
- [ ] VM 2: Program Control
- [ ] High Level Language
- [ ] Compiler 1: Syntax Analysis
- [ ] Compiler 2: Code Generation
- [ ] Operating System
